# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Backend API for Web Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up a lightweight web server using FastAPI or Flask to expose the detection engine's functionality via API endpoints. This will serve as the backend for the web UI.
# Details:
Use FastAPI for its performance and automatic docs. Create a `main.py` for the web server. Define two endpoints: one for text input (`/api/check`) that accepts a JSON payload with code, and one for file upload (`/api/analyze`) that accepts a file. These endpoints will use the engine and return results as JSON.

# Test Strategy:
Run the web server locally. Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send requests to the `/api/check` and `/api/analyze` endpoints. Verify that they return a 200 status code and a valid JSON response containing the analysis results.
