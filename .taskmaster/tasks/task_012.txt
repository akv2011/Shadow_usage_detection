# Task ID: 12
# Title: Finalize Documentation and Test Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive user documentation and a robust test suite to ensure the tool is reliable, easy to use, and maintainable.
# Details:
Write a detailed `README.md` file covering: project overview, installation instructions (for both CLI and web), usage examples for all CLI commands, and an explanation of the output format. Expand the test suite in `/tests` to have at least 80% code coverage, including integration tests for the CLI and API.

# Test Strategy:
Ask a new user to follow the `README.md` to install and run the tool. Their ability to do so without assistance is the primary test. Run a code coverage tool (e.g., `pytest-cov`) to verify test coverage meets the target. All tests must pass.
