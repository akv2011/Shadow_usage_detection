# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build CLI Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a command-line interface (CLI) for the tool, allowing users to run analysis directly from their terminal. This provides a fast and scriptable way to use the detection engine.
# Details:
Use Python's `argparse` or a more modern library like `click`. Implement the specified commands: `shadow-detect analyze <file>`, `shadow-detect check --text "..."`, and `shadow-detect scan <directory> --recursive`. Structure the CLI to call the appropriate functions from the parser and engine modules.

# Test Strategy:
Run each command from the terminal with valid and invalid arguments. Verify that `analyze` works with a single file, `check` with a string, and `scan` with a directory. Check that help messages (`-h` or `--help`) are displayed correctly.
