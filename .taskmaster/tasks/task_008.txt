# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Confidence Scoring Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the algorithm to convert the raw heuristic detection results into a quantitative confidence score (0-100%) and a qualitative risk level (Low, Medium, High).
# Details:
In the detection engine, create a scoring module. Assign a weight to each heuristic. The final score will be a weighted sum of the triggered heuristics, normalized to a 0-100 scale. Define thresholds for risk levels (e.g., 0-40% Low, 41-75% Medium, 76-100% High). The score should be part of the engine's output.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests that provide mock heuristic results to the scoring function. Assert that a file with many triggered heuristics gets a high score, and a file with few gets a low score. Verify that the risk levels correspond correctly to the score thresholds.
